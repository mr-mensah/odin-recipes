    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. 
      <br>A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. 
      <br>I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
   <li> ½ pound ground pork</li>
<li>½ pound lean ground beef</li>
<li>½ cup minced onion</li>
<li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
<li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
<li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
<li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
<li>1 ½ teaspoons dried basil</li>
<li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
<li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
<li>⅛ teaspoon white sugar</li>
<li>1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
<li>1 pound small-curd cottage cheese</li>
<li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
<li>3 large eggs</li>
<li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
<li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
<li>1 (16 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the meat: Cook the ground meat in a skillet until browned and crumbly. 
         <br>Add the onion and continue cooking until it's translucent. Stir in the canned tomato products, half of the parsley, garlic, basil, 1.5 teaspoons of salt, oregano, and sugar.</li>
<li>Cook the noodles: Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted water until they're al dente.</li>
<li>Make the cheese layer: Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, the remaining parsley, the remaining salt, and pepper in a bowl.</li>
<li>Assemble the lasagna: Layer the ingredients according to the recipe (starting with sauce and ending with mozzarella) until the lasagna is assembled.</li>
<li>Bake the lasagna: Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for about half an hour. Remove the foil and continue baking until the top is golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
